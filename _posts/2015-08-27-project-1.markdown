description: Ryan and Corey of Rhino Construction worked on numerous problem areas on my 1947 home's exterior. In just 5 days they replaced some problem siding, 6 windows, some rotten fascia boards, and both a front and rear entryway and stairs in ironwood and cedar. Perhaps the best part was Ryan's superior work ethic and professionalism, from the beginning quote to the call backs after the work was done. Very hard to find both craftsmanship and quality people these days. Thanks Rhino Construction! A 1947 house always needs work!
